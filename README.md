# NASA-space-apps-covid-2020

##Summary

All41 is an app that aims to pass positive messages to people who are in a psychologically delicate moment due to COVID-19. In it, throughout the day notifications will be sent to the smartphone of the person who downloads it, with messages passed by experts on the subject, in addition to the possibility of a person leaving a message that can reach another person anywhere in the world!.

###The idea is a subtle approach, showing that we are all fighting together and that no one is alone.
   Studies published by NASA were the basis for the whole idea of the app and how to address the problem. I repeat here the quote I made about the study "Characterization of Psychological Risk, Overlap with Physical Health, and Associated Performance in Isolated, Confined, Extreme (ICE) Environments".
   For the development, the React-Native framework was used and here comes one of the great challenges: I had never developed anything using this technology, even if I already wanted to do it in time. Initially I would participate in space apps with a group of friends, but they ended up canceling at the last minute, which made me think about giving up too, but I decided to accept this challenge and try to develop this project on my own (afterwards keep it with the help of the community) and with technology that Iâ€™ve never used before. I must confess that I am feeling completely fulfilled to be finishing this presentation on this project right now.
   
   ##Project Demo
   
   The way I chose to present my project was by video, which you can see here: ![VIDEO](https://youtu.be/kYKUwGksecc)
