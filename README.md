## Summary

All41 is an app that aims to pass positive messages to people who are in a psychologically delicate moment due to COVID-19. In it, throughout the day notifications will be sent to the smartphone of the person who downloads it, with messages passed by experts on the subject, in addition to the possibility of a person leaving a message that can reach another person anywhere in the world!.

## How I Addressed This Challenge

I know that the idea seems to be very simple but it is supposed to be exactly like that. A subtle approach that gradually gives people the idea that they are not alone. The problem is very serious, both the pandemic and the social isolation we are experiencing. It is known that this isolation has several consequences for the psychological, so much so that this theme has been a subject of study by NASA for years, as it is a "daily" situation for its astronauts and that is why it has developed methods and techniques to help prevent and combat possible problems. brought about by isolation. A study called "Characterization of Psychological Risk, Overlap with Physical Health, and Associated Performance in Isolated, Confined, Extreme (ICE) Environments" released by NASA recently deals with just that.

## How I Developed This Project

I have a great-aunt who is completely isolated because she is already old and there are several infected people near her house and, whenever we talk by phone she says it is very bad to depend on other people to do house shopping, for example. of not being able to receive visitors to eat a cake (which she loves to make) and talk. It is possible to feel that isolation is being complicated for her, just as it is being for many people. My idea is to try to help in some way.
   As I said in a topic above, the idea is a subtle approach, showing that we are all fighting together and that no one is alone.
   Studies published by NASA were the basis for the whole idea of ​​the app and how to address the problem. I repeat here the quote I made about the study "Characterization of Psychological Risk, Overlap with Physical Health, and Associated Performance in Isolated, Confined, Extreme (ICE) Environments".
   For the development, the React-Native framework was used and here comes one of the great challenges: I had never developed anything using this technology, even if I already wanted to do it in time. Initially I would participate in space apps with a group of friends, but they ended up canceling at the last minute, which made me think about giving up too, but I decided to accept this challenge and try to develop this project on my own (afterwards keep it with the help of the community) and with technology that I’ve never used before. I must confess that I am feeling completely fulfilled to be finishing this presentation on this project right now.

## Project Demo

The way I chose to present my project was by video, which you can see here: https://youtu.be/kYKUwGksecc
